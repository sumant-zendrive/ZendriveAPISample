This project contains samples to access Zendrive's REST API from iOS and Android.

iOS:
- The sample Xcode project fetches a list of trips for a given userId using the REST API. For every trip, it plots the trip on
  a map along with events like phone use/speeding/hard braking.
- The sample API key and userId have been hardcoded in the GeneralConstants.h file and can be changed to view date using your
  own API key and driverId.
